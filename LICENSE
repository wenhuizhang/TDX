2. LICENSES

  2.1 License. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Intel grants to You, for 
the Term, a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, 
revocable, limited license under Intel's intellectual property rights in the 
Materials, without the right to sublicense, to use the Materials solely for or in 
connection with your review and evaluation of the Materials (the "Purpose"). 
This includes the rights to make copies of the Materials and to generate 
binaries of the source code provided in the Materials as required to effectuate 
the Purpose.

  2.2 Restrictions. Except as authorized above, You will not: (a) use or modify 
the Materials in any other way; (b) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble 
the Materials provided in object form (except and only as specifically required 
under Section 2.5), or (c) use the Materials to violate or aid in the violation of 
any international human right. You will be liable for your subcontractor's acts 
or omissions. For the avoidance of doubt, Your license under Section 2.1 does 
not include the right to modify Materials delivered as source code and/or 
create derivative works.

  2.3 No Implied License. Except for the express license in Section 2.1, Intel 
  does not grant any express or implied licenses to you under any legal theory. 
Intel does not license You to make, have made, use, sell, or import any Intel 
technology or third-party products, or perform any patented process, even if 
referenced in the Materials. Any other licenses from Intel require additional 
consideration. Nothing in this Agreement requires Intel to grant any additional 
license.

  2.4 Feedback. If you give Intel comments or suggestions related to the 
Materials or Intel Components, Intel can use them in any way and disclose 
them to anyone, without payment or other obligations to you.

  2.5 Open Source Licenses. The Materials may include software subject to an 
  open source license, including licenses recognized by the Open Source Initiative 
(http://www.opensource.org). Nothing in this Agreement limits any rights 
under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable open source 
software license.

  2.6 Third-Party Software. Your use of any third-party software is subject to 
Your compliance with the license You obtain directly from that third-party. A 
listing of any such third-party software may be in a text file accompanying the 
Materials.

managers attempt to resolve the dispute. If we can't resolve the dispute in 30 
days, either of us may demand mediation and will then try to resolve the 
dispute with an impartial mediator. If we don't resolve the dispute within 60

remains fully 

  9.6 Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be valid unless 
in a writing signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party that 
specifies the waived provision. That signed waiver will not constitute a waiver 
of any other provision. A party's failure or delay in enforcing any provision will 
not operate as a waiver.

and Intel, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all 
prior agreements, between Intel and You concerning its subject matter.
